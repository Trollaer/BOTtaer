# BOTtaer: böt

Böt is a Discord bot with different features like music/backups and more.
There are a lot of bots out there. Böt combines some unique features you often need different bots for. The bot is not completely finished and continues to evolve.
Get böt for your server, [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=793383501936197634&permissions=8&scope=bot)

### Features
* Playing music and playlists from YouTube. You can easily pause/shuffle/loop/etc. by reacting to the message that shows what's currently playing.
* Monitoring:
  * You can monitor all members currently in the channel with 'böt' and record how long everyone is talking. Find the babble in your friend group.
  * If you can't here some one talking and talking, add a personal monitor. When the user talks more then you want him to, he gets muted.
* Save and load backups:
  * Create a backup of your server, that saves roles/channels/emojis/etc.
  * Load a backup via an ID. You can not just recreate the channels/roles but give everyone back his roles.
* Want to join a channel command, which allows you to request to join a channel, that you can see but not join. The users in this channel can vote you in or not.
* A soundboard that lets you play soundeffects via a browser tap. (Got some sounds to add? Join the discord!)
* Server hosting with status updates in Discord:
  * Add a IP where you are hosting servers on.
  * Then add the servers to the host. (e.g. a Minecraft Server)
  * Run the scripts on your host and get current status updates on the host or servers.
* Some smaller commands like:
  * Team creation based on who's in you voice channel.
  * Moving all user to an other channel.

### About this project
My friends and I use Discord as our main way of communication. We used some different Bots for some features like music. But there where some features we thought were missing and we couldn't find a Bot for it like team creation for some games based on who is in the voicechannel.
So ... as a IT-student with some free times in my holidays I started this project. 
What started out as a fun project, soon got a bit out of hand and I added the some functionalities like music or backups and others. Some maybe need some more time to perfect but they should be bug free. We tested everything on our Server. The code overall went through some changes and I know it's not perfectly readable (sometimes) but I'm on it.
I'm open for suggestions and tipps. Just join [this server](https://discord.gg/M986FMJ2G3) and help make this bot better!
