    , description: "Loads the channels/roles of a server-backup based on backupID, that you get when using '$backup'. With 'list' you can see all the backups for this server.\nYou can also reset the server an delete all channels/roles with 'reset'.\nWhen loading a backup you may sometimes see channels but can't join or type in them. Just quit Discord (not just the X). These are visual bugs."

    , explanation: "Give the single operations some time, when the server is huge the minute from the cooldown for this command might not be enough.\n**__Options:__**\n```ini\n['reset']: Resets the whole server by deleting all channels/roles.\n['list']: Shows you a list of all the backups for this server.\n[<backupID>]: Loads all channels/roles of the server-backup with the backupID. The server gets reseted first.\n[<backupID> roles]: Gives every user back the roles he previously had.\n [<backupID> noreset] Loads the server-backup without reseting first. Which means every role/channel gets added additionaly to the existing ones.```"
